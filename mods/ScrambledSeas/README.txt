### Scrambled Seas mod for Sailwind v0.15.2
### Version 5
### Author: Rahakami

This is a randomizer mod, which greatly increases the game difficulty by leaving it up to the player to discover and plot each island.
When a new game is started, a seed is generated for that savegame. That seed will result in a unique world map for you to explore. 
There is no helpful in-game map at the time, so draw a paper map while you play or come up with your own solution.

NOTE: not compatible with unmodded saves. Backup your saves before playing and start a New Game.

Features:
- Randomized island placement
- Starting gold is increased to 500, to help you get on your feet
- More details on Discord #sailwind-mods

Requirements:
This mod requires the Sailwind Mod Manager. Install it first.
